# Passive Aggressive (PA) Classifier 
is a type of online learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It falls under the category of supervised machine learning algorithms that are used for binary classification problems. PA classifiers work on the principle of being passive when the current model correctly classifies a training example, but aggressive when it makes a mistake. They are particularly useful when the data is large and continuously generated, such as in stream-based applications or in cases where the data is too big to fit in memory. The algorithm updates the model parameters as new examples are presented to it, making it an online learning algorithm. The PA classifier is implemented in scikit-learn and can be used with various parameters, including maximum step size (regularization), whether the intercept should be estimated or not, and the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm to converge.
